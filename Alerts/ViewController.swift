                                                       there are going to be 4 steps
    step1: create an alert controller== which is the manager or you can think of it as
           the whole unit
           the whole alert or 
           the whole pop up that we see
    step2: then we need to create an Alert action == the actions are the buttons with the connected responses when that button is tapped
    step3: then you need to connect the controller to the action
    step4: then you need to present the alert
